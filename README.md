Mobilis is a platform for collaborative mobile applications. Its main purpose is to support developers in buidling collaborative applications consisting of smartphone apps, server parts, Web-based clients and even ad-hoc connected nodes like sensors and actuators. For the mobile client part we are focusing on Android while we provide an HTML5 based client framework for all other platforms. But the main part of Mobilis is not cross-platform development or offering collaborative functionality under Android. It rather covers the whole application compound which typically consists of a server part and the network protocols, too. We provide a service hosting environment with dynamic deployment and runtime support. We further provide a mechanism to develop network protocols in a platform-independent and service-oriented way. The glue for all these parts is the eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) and its many community extensions.
